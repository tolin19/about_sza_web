    <h2>About SZA</h2>
    <div class="bio-content">
      <p>
        Solána Imani Rowe, known worldwide as <strong>SZA</strong>, is a Grammy-winning artist whose music 
        blends <em>R&B, neo-soul, and alternative sounds</em> with cosmic emotion and honesty. 
        Born in St. Louis, Missouri and raised in Maplewood, New Jersey, she began her rise 
        through the Top Dawg Entertainment label, crafting her unique sound rooted in vulnerability and power.
      </p>

      <p>
        With each era — from <em>Ctrl</em> to <em>SOS</em> — SZA has redefined modern soul. Her 2024 album 
        <strong>“Saturn”</strong> represents renewal, emotional maturity, and cosmic self-reflection — 
        a journey through heartbreak, healing, and growth under the watchful rings of the planet Saturn.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond her voice, SZA stands as a symbol of self-love, independence, and spiritual awakening. 
        Her artistry invites listeners to float through galaxies of sound and emotion, 
        reminding us that transformation is written in the stars.
